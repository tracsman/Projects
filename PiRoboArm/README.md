# PiRoboArm - A Robotic Arm controlled by a Raspberry PI and XBox controller

## Overview

I play a game on an Android table that I haven't figured out how to macro some repetitive movements, so this is an attempt to make a robot arm to do the repetitive button presses needed to get through some boring, but important, repetition in the game.

Using a OWI-535 arm with touch screen stylus attached, controlled by a Raspberry PI, I've got a script to bounce between two screen positions repeatedly.
